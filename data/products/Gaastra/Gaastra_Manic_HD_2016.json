    "en": "The 2016 Manics are back and better than ever. With an improved profile they deliver more stability; these are the ultimate competition wave sails. With its incredible wind range and newly designed smooth leech twist for increased top end speed. This range of sails delivers an unrivalled level of performance that any rider can enjoy.\nFor 2016 we have added the new convertible batten system to all the sizes in the range. This system allows the rider more control to customise their sail. Putting the shorter batten in place frees up the feeling in the rig and can be a useful tool to generate drive for light-wind wave riding.  A new panel layout with fewer seams makes the sail stronger and lighter. The shorter luff and boxy outline helps give a more compact feeling, great for riding and tightening up your turns.\nThe 4.5m and smaller sizes now come with the 4-batten configuration for less weight. A higher clew placement and more refined shaping delivers a better direct response to the sail. New batten shaping in the front third of the sail and a more even profile curve gives better handling and control. The improved posi leech keeps the sail perfectly balanced. The Manic HD is perfect for riders looking for that bit of extra sail strength; the reinforced monofilm panels will set your mind at ease.\nThe Manic and Manic HD have the lightest hand pressure of all our wave ranges. This sail is the complete package – great early planing, acceleration and awesome control when things get wild."
