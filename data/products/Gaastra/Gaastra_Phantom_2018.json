    "en": "Racing performance with ease.\n\nFOR WHO:\nThose wanting racing performance in a lighter and easier to use package.\nPerfect for free racers that want the speed and power of a racing sail but don’t want to commit to the full-on racing engine we call the Vapor.\nSome of the international team believe if conditions are right the Phantom is as quick as the Vapor. Some even choose the Phantom for racing and training for the tour.\nIt´s been carefully design to offer you that perfect balance of early planing and top end speed.\nThe Phantom range has less cams and less battens making it less stable at high end overpowered conditions that the Vapor is built to handle."
