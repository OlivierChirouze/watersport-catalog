    "en": "PURE\nThe light handling and great direct response acceleration of the new Pure will guarantee to bring success to anyone who is wanting to push their performance through the roof.\n\n \n\nThe Pure is the very best performance freestyle sail for any sailor looking to improve their sailing level. It has long been regarded as the benchmark sail in its category and the chosen weapon by many of the top professional sailors on the world tour. Super light in the hands and an even balance imparts the sailor with maximum control while attempting their tricks. A new smooth leech twist will allow the very latest manoeuvres to be practiced and dialled with ease.\nThe 2016 Pure has a new outline with a smaller head and greater foot area for a more even, balanced feeling. The new panel layout with less seams makes for a lighter, stronger sail while the vertical radial seams in the upper part of the rig keep the sail totally stable.\n\n \n\nOur international team requested the revised sizes with a new 4.0m and 4.6m to better suit the total wind range. A stabilized head configuration and compact batten positioning aid in providing the best Pure sail performance to date.\nThe light handling and great direct response acceleration of the new Pure will guarantee to bring success to anyone who is wanting to push their performance through the roof.\n\nTONKY FRANS\n\n“I am so stoked with the new Pure; it’s another level. I can throw the sail wherever I need to and it’s incredibly predictable, so I know I will land my tricks with style.”"
