    "en": "COSMIC\nEXTRA POWER & LOCKED IN STABILITY\n\n \n\nIf you want that little bit extra power and locked in stability without the hassle of  traditional cambered sails, the COSMIC delivers greatness that you won’t believe till you sail it!\n\nThe COSMIC is designed for enthusiastic Freeride Blasters looking for a sail with a little more bottom end power and drive to get you going and keep you charging through the lulls. This 2 cambered powerhouse is simple and effortless to rig, light in the hands like you can’t believe and furiously fast!\n\nThe new COSMIC´s twin cam system has all the grunt you need to breeze through lulls and reach new top speeds. A new reduced constant curve luff design keeps the sail maneuverable and a new outline with smaller head improves on water power agility and dynamic response of the sail. A performance panel layout with lightweight luff pocket reduces overall weight of the rig to keep up-hauling and water starting simple.\n\n \n\nNew for 2017:\n\nNew constant curve Luff curve and sail outline.\nIncreased POSI-LEECH with new dynamic cut-out.\nReduced boom through new inset clew geometry\nRedesigned foot geometry\nNew Lightweight simplified panel layout improves strength and weight\nNew Optimised batten layouts with 7 battens from 7.2 up and 6 battens from 6.7 down\nBEN VAN DER STEEN\n\n“The Cosmic is prefect for sailing where the wind is feeling thin and less powerful. The cosmic can’t be beaten for early planing and lightness in the hands. It handles choppy water with ease, keeps accelerating and never gets tired, always on the go!”"
