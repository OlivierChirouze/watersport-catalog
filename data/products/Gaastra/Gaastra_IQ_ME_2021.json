    "en": "Combining the next level range of use, neutrality and jumping abilities of the IQ with the most premium construction available – the IQ ME does not cut down on anything! Adding a membrane construction to our impressively performing IQ meant, we needed to do something different and not just change the material. Our design team came up with a continuous panel construction with no interruption of the fibres through shaping seams. Continuous panels for the foot, centre, luff and leech of the sail prevent interruptions of the Aramid fibers for a perfect flow of the load across the sail’s profile, which leads to an inimitably smooth feeling and impressive lightness of the IQ ME."
