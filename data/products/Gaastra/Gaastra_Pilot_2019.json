    "en": "The Pilot is designed for sailors, who look for top performance and high quality at a maximum value.\n\nEverybody, who enjoys a smooth freeride session and is making his first steps into the foot straps will love the Pilot. The relaxed luff curve improves compatibility with nearly any mast brand, making the Pilot an economical sail for families. The backhanded profile offers enough power to move even heavier older boards, offering an affordable option to make your first steps in windsurfing. Super smooth batten rotation and progressive pull make the sail very easy to handle and a breeze to learn on. More advanced riders will appreciate the progressive profile and compact outline, providing superb maneuverability and planing power to make sure, you get the most out of every session."
