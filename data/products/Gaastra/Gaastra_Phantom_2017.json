    "en": "The PHANTOM is THE performance freerace sail. It combines the reduced weight and technical ease of a 2+1 batten cam sail with the performance of a full blown race sail.\nThe 2017 PHANTOM has a new high aspect outline and smaller sail head. We have increased the amount of shape in the head of the sail and this in combination with the new outline and constant curve mast result in a sail that has better power down low with superior speed at the top end. The new PHANTOM uses the performance GA twin cam system but this year we have added a third removable camber above the boom. This additional camber gives the sail a “next” level of performance, making it the ideal sail for those looking to progress their racing  skills.  With two cams the sail is lighter, and a bit more simple we can say. With three cams the new Phantom unlocks a whole new level of speed and stability enabling you to cross the finish line first!\nNew for 2017:\nAll new constant curve Luff curve\nNew high aspect outline\nNew Removable Cam creating an broader tuning range\nImproved POSI-LEECH with new dynamic cut-out for more power and agility.\nInset clew geometry for reduced boom length\nNew Integrated Batten Technology improves efficiency, response and rig weight\nNew Lightweight performance panel layout for a maximum strength to weight ratio"
