  "description": {
    "en": "The Matrix will not just get experienced freeride windsurfers into lay-down jibes, but also allows those to enjoy this sport, who are just getting into planing.\n\nWith several new features this yearâ€™s Matrix is more than ever the perfect choice for freeride sailors, who need maximum performance without having to miss ease of use and a light feeling in their hands.\n\nThe introduction of the new angled parallel batten concept and the New Cross Batten, combined with a slightly reduced Posi Leech, helped us to increase the top-end performance without losing any bit of handling in all conditions. The New Cross Batten geometry maintains the power generating volume under the boom and the angled battens push the profile lower down into the sail foot to achieve a lower center of gravity. The Matrix 6.7 is now featured with 7 battens for better stability.\n\nThis freeride sail with racing pedigree offers powerful and high performance, while always being simple to use and jibe. Freeride sailors around the globe love and will always love the Matrix."
