    "en": "The ultimate freestyle weapon. Made to get up and go with utmost and precise control. We had to redesign this incredible sail to use on the CC masts and we found some new tricks for getting more power and better control. The new twist characteristics on the PURE are coming from the mast. We can put more shape up high in the sail and get a better release of unwanted power. This gives the sail more balance when ducking the sail into the wind for hard core freestyle moves.\nThis leading edge Freestyle sail not only does wonders for our team riders battling for the top of the podium, it also serves as a great sail for teaching your friends and makes for a great ladies rig that want something super light and easy to manage.\nAll new Constant Curve Luff shape.\nNew Outline with Improved POSI-LEECH system\nPerformance Panel Layout for maximum strength and minimum weight.\nNew lower batten layout improving sail balance\nNEW INTEGRATED BATTEN TECHNOLOGY in the top 2 battens"
