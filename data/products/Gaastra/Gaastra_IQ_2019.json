    "en": "The IQ is designed for those, who want to break the rules and go for bigger aerials, more powerful cutbacks and higher 360s than anybody else at any spot in the world does.\n\nSpecifically designed to fit many of our top wave riders requests, including former world champion Thomas Traversa, the IQ must shine in all conditions, you might face. Past year’s very successful design was updated with the brand-new parallel batten concept and new shaping numbers in the foot batten. We achieved great results, increasing the softness in the sail and its top-end, without losing any bit of speed and agility. Today, with the IQ 2019 in your hands, it is more comfortable to make turns and do moves, so you can immediately focus on your next maneuver.\n\nAlso the panel layout was updated by our development team, designing a smaller monofilm window to increase the IQ’s durability. The new 4 mil Metallic X-Ply and 1.75 mil Metallic 2-Ply make the full 4 batten wave sail shine in brand-new exciting colors. Constructed with 4 battens in all sizes, the IQ is also equipped with our Convertible Batten System, allowing you to use the sail with a short batten above the boom. Be everywhere on the wave, you want to be and throw down impressive moves with the IQ 2019!"
