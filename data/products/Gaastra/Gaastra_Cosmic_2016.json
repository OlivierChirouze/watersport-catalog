    "en": "Cosmic\nResponsive!\nWith an improved top end speed whilst still remaining locked in. Light to handle with an extensive wind range capacity.\n\n \n\nThe twin-cam freeride sail that no other can match. With a narrower luff sleeve than the Vapor or Phantom, it remains perfectly simple to uphaul and rotate no matter how much time you might be in the water rather than on it. Great for first time races and for sailors that otherwise might shy away from cams.\nFor 2016 the Cosmic has had a new panel layout with less seams to make the sail stronger and lighter than ever. It has also undergone a similar small luff curve change to the Matrix, for a better maximum KMH capacity. The smoother leech line has improved the direct response acceleration whilst not losing any of the low-end power of the rig.\n\nNew batten shaping in the front third of the sail has created a more even shape to the sail … and combined with the posi leech system, compact batten positioning and stabilised head configuration, the Cosmic is more complete then ever for the new season.\nResponsive! With an improved top end speed whilst still remaining locked in.  Light to handle with an extensive wind range capacity.\n\nSEBASTIAN KOERDEL\n\n“The Cosmic is perfect for sailing on lake’s such as Garda where the wind is feeling thin and less powerful. The cosmic can’t be beaten for early planning and lightness in the hands. It handles choppy water with ease whilst keeping a smooth locked in feeling”"
