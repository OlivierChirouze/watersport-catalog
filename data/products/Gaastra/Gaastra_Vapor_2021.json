  "description": {
    "en": "We took several steps forward, while designing the 2021 Vapor in order to provide our team and every speed enthusiast with the perfect mix of acceleration, lightness and top speed. An incredibly light feeling is achieved by implementing a 7 batten configuration on all sizes and by simplifying the panel layout without unnecessary seams. We increased the luff curve and worked on the shaping of the profile so that stability and a constant feeling across the whole range is ensured in all conditions. The Vapor constantly pulls forward with less back hand pressure, which leads to enormous acceleration, low end performance and significantly higher average speed, while fatigue is minimized."
