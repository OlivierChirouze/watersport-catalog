  "description": {
    "en": "A smooth neutral waveriding sail has never been as controllable and powerful as this IQ. While we redesigned the complete range last year, we focused on detailed improvements on each single size to make them work perfectly in exactly those conditions, you’ll use them in. With an adjustment to the IQ’s profile and outline, we achieved a more direct and responsive feeling throughout the whole range. An impressively lightweight construction thanks to the 1.75 and 2.5 mil 2-Ply adds a light feeling to the IQ, which offers a stable profile due to the Carbon Radial Tapes. The IQ reached new levels of range of use, neutrality on the wave and jumping abilities."
