  "description": {
    "en": "The Pilot is a dedicated sail design for riders, who look for the perfect blend of performance, high quality and a maximum value. Everybody, who enjoys a smooth freeride session or is making his first steps into the foot straps will love the Pilot. The relaxed luff curve improves compatibility with nearly any mast brand, making the Pilot an economical sail for families. Super smooth batten rotation, progressive pull and the backhanded profile offer enough power to move and manoeuvre even heavier older boards. The lightweight construction of the Pilot makes it suitable for everybody, who wants to enjoy a smooth windsurfing session."
