    "en": "This is the right sail for everybody, who doesn’t want to be overtaken by anybody at the local spot without having to pass on comfort and ease of use. With the Cosmic’s already impressive low end power we focused on adding control and performance in the top end. We opted for a straight leech, reducing the Posi Leech and did some tuning to the shaping of the seams, which lead to a perfect mix of power in the low end and control in the top end. While the Cosmic sparks your urge to accelerate and go faster than ever before with its two small cambers, it is still extremely convenient to rig and the rotation of the battens during jibes will fascinate you."
