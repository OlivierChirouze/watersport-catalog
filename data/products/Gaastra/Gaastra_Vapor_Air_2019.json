    "en": "If you are looking for the right sail to beat your friends during a foil race or the professional fleet on the course, the Vapor Air is the right choice and ready to impress you with its elaborate performance.\n\nWe have worked on the Vapor Air for several years and thanks to the close cooperation of head of sail design Peter Munzlinger and our successful foil racing team this sail is at the starting line to dominate the racing courses around the world.\n\nWith more high aspect and a tighter leech than a slalom sail, the Vapor Air is a completely new concept of racing sail. Eight battens and four cambers provide the sail with a balanced profile that offers great performance both on upwind and downwind tacks.\n\nThe Vapor Air has been developed with our very successful foil racing team around vice world champion Sebastian Kördel and this team will utilize this brand-new high-performance foil racing sail to be on top of the PWA World Tour rankings in 2019. But not only our international team will admire the Vapor Air’s impressive performance, every foil windsurfer, who is looking for a sail that offers the best in performance and handling should hold the Vapor Air in his hands."
