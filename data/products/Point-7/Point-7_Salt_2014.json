    "en": "What it’s all about?\n\nThe Salt is our all out performance orientated 4 batten wave sail. With a high skin tension and tighter leech, Point-7 has creating a very manoeuvre and reactive oriented ride maintaining a slightly flatter batten profile. The Salt is fast riding on the waves, quick to respond and ultra light in your hands.\n\nWhat’s new for 2014?\n\nThe SALT has been part of a continuous evolution since first introduced in 2012. Each size is tested separately according to the designated wind intensity for which the sail designed. With the introduction in 2014 of the new SLASH freestyle sail, the development of the SALT to become a pure new school wave sail. The individual changes made on each size have been made very specific to create the perfect sail range. Sail profile, rotation and twist was tuned on each size to make the sails feel more free and lighter in the hands to allow for the riders to focus on the real deal. The clew has been raised 4cm to balance the sail better and give a more reactive leech in lighter winds. The SALT 4g has been developed specifically on the C80 rdm masts."
