    "en": "SPEED HAS A NAME. MEET THE NEW EVO XI.\n\nThe technology, ideas and concepts that are created and refined during the RS:Racing development process are ultimately applied to all of the sails in the NeilPryde range. Last year’s EVOX has introduced a milestone in the history of development of racing sails. Countless victories have shown the success of this new sail technology.\n\nAt NeilPryde we live and breathe innovation, however, seeing the performance of the EVOX we were for the first time hesitant to make deep cutting changes, because why change something that outperforms already on so many levels? Therefore, we focused on tweaking and improving some minor imperfections to make this year’s EVOXI, the 18th sail of the RS:Racing Evo series, even better than its predecessor while not fully revolutionizing it."
