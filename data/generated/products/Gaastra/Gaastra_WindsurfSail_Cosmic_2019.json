    "en": "Freeride sailors and free racers looking for speed and power that´s easy to handle and control.\n\nUnleashing the Cosmic’s performance has never been so easy, as with the 2019 collection. Designed to enable freeriders the inimitable feeling of high top speeds and lay-down jibes, the Cosmic is the perfect combination of power and handling. It feels incredibly light in your hands and will motivate you to go faster than ever.\n\nThis year’s Cosmic features a wider mast sleeve, a higher aspect ratio in the bigger sizes and,just like the Matrix, the new angled parallel batten concept and the New Cross Batten, which, combined with a slightly reduced Posi Leech, helped us to increase the top-end performance. With the New Cross Batten geometry, we’ve been able to maintain the power generating volume under the boom, while the angled battens push the profile lower down in the sail foot to achieve a lower center of gravity. For 2019 we added one batten to the 6.7 and 6.2 to increase its stability.\n\nExperience how easy speed and performance can be with the Cosmic 2019 and enjoy its effortless rigging and handling."
