  "description": {
    "en": "The Air Ride is a dedicated freeride foiling concept, which combines the benefits of a high aspect construction with lightness and manoeuvrability. For 2021 we improved the batten rotation above the boom of the 5.7 and 6.7 for a super smooth ride and jibing in lightest winds. On the 7.7 we stabilized the upper leech and flattened the entry of the luff, which in combination with the slightly reduced foot area improves its jibing characteristics. The impressively light construction combines performance to get in the air with ease of use and a balanced feeling, making the Air Ride the right choice for foiling at all skill levels."
