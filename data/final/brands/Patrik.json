    "en": "Shaped from over 25 years of technical expertise, DEDICATION AND PERFORMANCE, PATRIK is far more than just another name in windsurfing. From humble beginnings as shop customers themselves to high-profile brand employees and World-Tour professionals, Patrik and Karin’s move to founding their own brand in 2010 was simply a natural progression. Today many of windsurfing’s finest products sport PATRIK’s name and the brand remains dedicated to delivering unique products and providing personal service."
