    "en": "FOIL RACING. REDEFINED.\n\nWe are extremely excited to introduce the new Flight EVOII to the range. Experience foil racing like nothing before, thanks to the refined high aspect ratio of the sail.\n\nThe new 7-batten layout of the sail makes it lighter overall, and dramatically improves its handling especially during maneuvers, which is extremely important in foil racing.\n\nWe made it our mission to equip and design this sail to be the must-have for foil championships and racers that seek nothing more than their next victory. This sail is an evolution of its predecessor, fully delivering on the high aspect ratio needed to speed through your next finish line effortlessly. The Flight EVOII comes in race-ready construction and we have further optimized the balance of speed and control.\n\nThis sail has it all: speed, gracious design, stability and control, and it wonâ€™t let you down, no matter if upwind, downwind or reaching.\n\nQuench your thirst for speed with the new Flight EVOII."
