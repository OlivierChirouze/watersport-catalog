  "description": {
    "en": "The RS:RACING EVOXII is more than an evolution from its predecessor, it is a step towards a new design, fully embracing the high aspect design we introduced in our Flight series.\n\nWith racing competition formats and courses evolving towards a mix of Slalom and Foiling, we want to be sure to be ahead of the game, ensuring the new RS:RACING EVOXII performs equally well on fin as on foil.\nThe EVOXII features a moderate high aspect ratio, where the larger sail sizes have a relatively higher aspect ratio than the smaller sail sizes. This design ensures that also the smaller sizes have that extra lift and efficiency, allowing the rider to get the maximum out of the sail.\n\nThanks to the high aspect ratio, we could eliminate the the larger sizes from the range, as the 9.0 will perform in the same way as a 9.4 in lighter winds.\nThe high aspect ratio especially impacts the luff length and boom size needed per sail. The bigger the sail, the more pronounced is its high aspect ratio, meaning that the bigger size sails will need smaller booms in relation.\n\nThe RS:RACING EVOXII will come with new sizes and larger gaps in between, as we have improved the wind range; meaning we can cover wider wind ranges with less sizes. RS:RACING EVOXII â€“ the art of racing, made for you."
