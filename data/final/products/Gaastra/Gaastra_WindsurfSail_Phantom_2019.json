  "description": {
    "en": "In case you want to chase the professional slalom sailors at your home spot and don’t want to commit to a full-on racing engine, the Phantom is the sail of choice for you.\n\nThe Phantom 2019 offers performance in its purest form, being placed a little closer to the concept of the Vapor, our PWA slalom sail. Its sizes match those of the Vapor and the mast sleeve’s width and the outline are well more similar. Updating the luff curve numbers allowed us to further increase the performance, maintaining the well-requested accessibility, you expect from our Phantom.\n\nIt features the brand-new angled parallel batten concept and the New Cross Batten, which allowed us to maintain the power generating volume under the boom, while the profile is pushed down lower into the sail foot for a lower center of gravity. The slightly reduced Posi Leech will get you more top-end control than ever before. No matter, if you want to cruise around the lake with top speed or take part in amateur competitions, the Phantom’s performance will immediately win your heart, just like it did with some of our top PWA riders."
