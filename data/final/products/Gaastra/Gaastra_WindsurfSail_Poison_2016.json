    "en": "The 2016 Poison is the traditional 5 batten power wave sail from our range and is the highest aspect of the 3 wave sail ranges. The Poison has a super efficient low-end performance while keeping tonnes of high-end control and amazing top speed.\nWith a balanced feeling in the hands the Poison is slightly firmer than the Manic and IQ, which can appeal to the weekend wave sailor wanting a no fuss early planing wave warrior.\nThis year the Poison has a new panel layout with fewer seams, making the sail lighter and stronger. A very small change to the outline and batten position has made the sail slightly more compact. Refined shaping and luff curve has yet again improved the low-end performance. The new batten profile with more front-end curve has locked the power of the sail forward while the Poison’s unique smooth leech twist delivers a most supersonic top end speed.\nA higher clew and posi leech combination has also helped to keep the balance of the rig equal between the front and backhand.\nThe Poison is the classic wave sail designed for those sailors looking for an earlier planing, manageable power wave rig. It is reliable, making even in the gustiest of conditions playful and exciting."
