    "en": "The Cross is our bump and jump, faster blaster. This sail is perfect for riders that want to have light handling and great turning in waves but also might like a sail that they can combine with a free ride board for some flat water blasting. The Cross really crosses over, with both normal and tube battens the rig can be controlled with ease at high speed and in gusty conditions.\nFor 2016 the Cross had some refined shaping added along with a small adjustment to the luff curve to make an even smoother, faster sail. New panel layout with fewer seams makes for a lighter and stronger sail.\nA revised leech outline, combined with our posi leech system has improved the low-end performance, while the new batten shaping has added great depth to the forward third of the sail, creating a super stable feel that pulls you through your turns and accelerates you in the gusts.\nThe best of both worlds, the Cross has it all. Extreme versatility that will fit any board or any condition. The Cross is fast, fun and friendly, with incredible range."
