  "description": {
    "en": "The Pure helps the creative minds of freestyle windsurfers unfold, when they come up with new moves and learn the most radical rotations. We redesigned the luff curve and the shaping in the centre of the sail in order to make it flatter and add support of the sail head, which leads to more control and easier ducking of the sail. By stiffening the main batten we improved the overall stability and performance, allowing you to feel comfortably powered during your first moves and the most radical ones, youâ€™re going to learn. This no compromise design accelerates your progress in freestyle windsurfing."
