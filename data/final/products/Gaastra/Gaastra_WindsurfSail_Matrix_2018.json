    "en": "High performance no-cam Freeride for everyone. A world class test winning freeride sail designed for anyone any time.\n\nFOR WHO:\nRegardless if youâ€™re just getting into planing or already been a windsurfer for 20 years, the Matrix has everything you need to make the most of your sailing session.\nThe new Matrix is the ultimate choice for freeride sailors looking for maximum performance in an easy to use, light in the hands, no camber rig. In 2018 a new outline combined with updated profile ensure a more constant and evenly distributed power delivery. Increased mid and top twist result in a sail with even more top end speed than previous seasons. No cross batten keeps the outline compact and the boom length short improving handling in all conditions.\nWhen you just want to enjoy a windy weekend or race around with some friends the Matrix is the sail of choice for free ride sailors around the globe."
