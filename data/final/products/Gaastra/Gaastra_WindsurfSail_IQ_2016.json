  "description": {
    "en": "The IQ is the most dynamic and direct new school wave sail in the range. The 2016 IQ has been reshaped and re-cut to fit the needs of the most radical sailors.  The short boxy outline, and soft lightweight handling will have you turning sharper and deeper right in the pocket of the wave. The newly improved luff curve and compact batten positioning has added more control in the stronger winds, giving a much larger wind range to the IQ.\nThe 2016 IQ has a new panel layout with fewer seams, which makes the sail both stronger and lighter. Refined shaping in key load areas and a heightened clew have made for an improved balanced feeling that delivers a more direct response.  Modified shaping at the second batten has given a better high end wind range that can help stick those tricky landings cleanly.\nThe convertible batten system allows you to customise your sail, creating a softer feel for light wind riding, or control and stability for powered up conditions. An improved posi leech system enhances the IQ’s unique balanced feeling of power and control.\nThe IQ offers an awesome compact feeling that will blow your mind when riding in any conditions – super stable and full of control even in the craziest winds. If you want the perfect balance of a new school rig with controllable power, then the IQ is the one for you."
