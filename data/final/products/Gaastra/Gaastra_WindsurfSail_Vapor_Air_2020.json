  "description": {
    "en": "The sail that won the 2019 PWA World Tour Foiling will once again push the limits of foil racing in 2020. While the Vapor Airâ€™s aspect remains extremely high to maximize aerodynamic efficiency, we updated the smaller sizes with a slightly different outline and a dropped clew Cross Batten in order to further reduce the boom length and increase manoeuvrability. Each size is particularly designed for a certain purpose, which allows you to have the right sail for both upwind and slalom foil races, but all sizes come with exceptional performance in light winds and a light feeling to make you fly over the line in first place."
